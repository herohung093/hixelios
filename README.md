## Getting Started

We recommend that you always use the latest version of XCode.

### Requirements

- [XCode 10.1](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)

### Installing Dependencies

First, clone the repository on to your local machine.
Before you can build the project, you must install the dependencies via CocoaPods.

To do this, open up the terminal in the project folder and type:
```
pod install
```

### Building

First, open XCode.
Because the project uses CocoaPods, you should open the .xcWorkspace (instead of the .xcodeproj)
Finally, select a build target and hit the Run button.
